# pytorchnn

### Description
<p>This project contains all the fundamentals of using and implementing an image classifier neural network using PyTorch libraries.</p>

### Getting Started
#### 1. Clone the repo.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Haxodrat/pytorchnn.git
```
#### 2. Install the pytorch package/dependencies.
```bash
pip install torch
```
#### 3. Train the model.
```bash
# Uncomment the training loop code, comment the prediction code, and run the py file with python.
python torchnn.py
```
#### 4. Use the model to make predictions on the sample images.
```bash
# Comment the training loop code, uncomment the prediction code, replace the image file with a desired sample image, and run the py file with python.
python torchnn.py
```
